	- Maximum precipitation on a single day in period (year or month). Precipitation is deposition of water on the Earth's surface, either rain, snow, ice or hail. The ETCCDI short name for this variable is "Rx1day".
- **Maximum 5-day precipitation**
	- mm
	- Maximum precipitation in five consecutive days in the given period (month or year). Precipitation is deposition of water on the Earth's surface, either rain, snow, ice or hail. The ETCCDI short name for this variable is "Rx5day".

#### HSI variables
- Heat index
	- °C
	- Heat index is a heat stress indicator used by the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) National Weather Service for issuing heat warnings. It is calculated using multiple linear regression based on daily maximum temperature and relative humidity (calculated from daily mean specific humidity and surface pressure).
- Humidex
	- °C
	- Humidex is a heat stress indicator used by Canadian meteorological services. It is calculated as linear combination of daily maximum temperature and vapour pressure (calculated from daily mean specific humidity and surface pressure).
- Indoor universal thermal climate index
	- °C
	- The indoor universal thermal climate index is defined as the air temperature of a reference outdoor environment that would elicit in the human body the same physiological model’s response (sweat production, shivering, skin wettedness, skin blood flow and rectal, mean skin and face temperatures) as the actual environment. Here, a polynomial approximation based on near-surface air temperature, solar radiation, vapor pressure, and wind speed is used for calculating the universal thermal climate index. In the present dataset, the influence of solar radiation and wind speed is not considered, and the universal thermal climate index is calculated from near-surface air temperature and vapor pressure solely, thus representing indoor conditions.
- Wet-bulb temperature
	- °C
	- The wet-bulb temperature index is a heat stress indicator that indicates the human cooling capacity through sweating. It is calculated from the equivalent potential temperature based on daily maximum temperature and water vapour mixing ratio (calculated from daily mean specific humidity and surface pressure).
- Indoor wet-bulb globe temperature
	- °C
	- Indoor wet-bulb globe temperature is a heat stress indicator that is calculated as weighted mean of wet-bulb temperature, globe temperature, and daily maximum temperature. In the present dataset, the influence of solar radiation and wind speed is not considered and wet-bulb globe temperature is calculated as weighted mean of wet-bulb temperature and daily maximum temperature (neglecting globe temperature). It thus represents indoor conditions.
